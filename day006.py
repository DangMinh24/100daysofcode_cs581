Q6: The numerical values of coins have been arranged so that the greedy algorithm
will result in the smallest number of coins when making change. This means
that the largest valued coin is tried first, and as many of those coins are used
as possible. Then the next smaller denomination coin is used, and so on until
the pennies are dealt out. For 84 cents in change, a half-dollar could be used
(leaving 34 cents), then a quarter (leaving 9 cents), a nickel (leaving 4 cents),
and 4 pennies. If no half-dollar coin was available, then quarters would be
used in its place: 3 quarters, followed by a nickel and four pennies. Write a
program that reads a number between 1 and 99 that is an amount of change
to be given, and prints the coin values that would be used


a) Three floating point variables a, b, and c have been read in from the
    console. Write a set of if statements that prints these in descending order.
b) If the value of 1.0/7.0 is printed, there are many numbers to the right of
    the decimal place. Devise a way to print only three places and write some
    Python code to test the idea.
c) Calculate an approximation to pi. There is an infinite series called the
    Gregory-Leibniz series that sums to pi. The series is
        Π = 4/1 – 4/3 + 4/5 – 4/7 + 4/9 – 4/11 ....
        
    Write a program that calculates the result of the first 15 terms of this series.
    How many digits of pi are correct? Add six more terms. How many digits are
    correct now?
d) Another series that can calculate pi is the Nilakantha series. It is a little
    more complicated to calculate, but gets close to pi much faster than does
    the Gregory-Leibniz series of Exercise 9. The Nilakantha series is
    Π = 3 + 4/(2*3*4) – 4/(4*5*6) + 4/(6*7*8) – 4/(8*9*10) ...
    Calculate the first 15 terms of this series. How many digits of PI are correct?
